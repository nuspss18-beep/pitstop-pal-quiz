## How the Quiz Works

The quiz contains **14 questions** in total:

- **Q1 to Q7** are **core questions**
- **Q8 to Q14** are **non-core questions**

---

## Scoring Logic

### Core Questions (Q1–Q7)

These questions are weighted more strongly.

For each core question:

- if the **core answer** is chosen:
  - selected pal gets **+2**
  - paired opposite pal gets **-1**

- if the **non-core answer** is chosen:
  - selected pal gets **+1**
  - the other pal gets **0**

### Example

For a core question paired between **Perry** and **Ping**:

- choosing **Perry** gives:
  - `Perry +2`
  - `Ping -1`

- choosing **Ping** gives:
  - `Ping +1`
  - `Perry +0`

This makes the first 7 questions more decisive in shaping the final result.

---

### Non-Core Questions (Q8–Q14)

These questions follow normal scoring.

For each non-core question:

- selected pal gets **+1**
- no other pal loses points

---

## Result Logic

At the end of the quiz:

1. The program checks all 7 pal scores.
2. The pal with the **highest score** becomes the result.
3. If there is a tie:
   - the program checks the user’s answer history from the most recent answer backwards
   - the tied pal chosen most recently wins the tie-break

This helps produce a more natural final result.
